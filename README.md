This project is about analyzing sales and customer data for an e-commerce store. We use SQL to clean and query the data, like finding the top-selling products and the total sales for each product. Then, we use Excel-like functions in Python to summarize customer purchases, group data by customer type (like regular or VIP), and calculate how much each customer bought.
We also create charts to visualize the sales and finally save the results to an Excel file, which can be downloaded and viewed in Excel. This project helps understand sales trends and customer behavior in a simple and organized way.
